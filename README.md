Why Culture?
------------

At elos we want to build solutions to human problems. We see personal growth and improvement as a challenge which requires a team of people to solve.

We believe that any team needs culture, a set of shared values, a collection of expected behavior, that allows the ordinary team to overcome
expectations and supercede mediocrity.

Culture is important. At elos we articulate and protect it.
