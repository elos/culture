Documentation
=============

Overview
--------

Documentation is less important than testing. Documentation serves to record and order thoughts on higher level design and architecture decisions. At elos documentation is a form of essay writing.

We document culture, ideas, design decisions, project planning, progress and strategies. Documentation of code is inline comments. We have no high level "API-esque" list-of-functions documentation. We prefer codification and organization of higher level principles, the code is a manifestation of these ideas.

Document:
---------

 * Design and architecture decisions
 * Decisions perceived to be controversial
 * Any under-represented aspect of elos culture and protocol
 * Ideas important to elos prospect

If something is _expected_ it should be _visible_. Documentation provides for the prominence of codified ideas.

Praxis:
-------

At elos we also codify certain protocols and practices. Whenever there is something implicit that can be articuluted explicitly, record it [here](https://github.com/elos/culture/tree/master/protocol)
