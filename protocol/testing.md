Testing
=======

Frameworks
----------

We will be consistent about the testing frameworks that we use. Ensuring that every developer can efficiently read every spec sets a low barrier to entry for contribution, and can behave as short-term documentation for common behaviors.

If you are the first developer to work in a language, it is your responsability to choose the testing framework that elos will use for projects in that language. Preferred framworks will:

- have an [RSpec](http://rspec.info/)-style syntax
- be capable of both unit and integration testing
- be runnable from the command line
- work with a CI platform such as [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/first_sync)
- be trivial to set up, in order to save time with multi-platform testing
