Resolving Conflict
------------------

Conflict can stem from disagreement, but most often arises from the elos tradition of _ownership_.

Any member of the team can express discontent at there assignment/task if they feel that contradicts their mission,
    or, less philosophically eloquent, if they feel the suggestion/assignment is stupid.

This discontent is and should always be expressed immediately, and dealt with by examination of company culture and mission.
