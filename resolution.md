Resolving Conflict
------------------

Conflict can stem from disagreement, but most often arises from the elos tradition of _[ownership](https://github.com/elos/culture/blob/master/ownership.md)_.

Any member of the team can express discontent at their assignment or task if they feel that the assignment is stupid, a waste a time, ill-defined, or contradicts company or personal mission.

Any discontent should be expressed immediately, and dealt with by examination of company culture, plans, and mission.
